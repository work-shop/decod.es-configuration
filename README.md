# Decodes Configuration

This repository contains public details of the decodes server configuration, which pairs a simple nginx fileserver serving the static site with a node server process that listens for pushes to a set of git repositories, and triggers builds of the static site using [custom site generation tooling](http://github.com/work-shop/decod.es).
